As we have seen, pairs provide a primitive “glue” that we can use to construct compound data objects.

The ability to create pairs whose elements are pairs is the essence of list structure’s importance as a representational tool. 


One of the useful structures we can build with pairs is a sequence—an ordered collection of data objects. There are, of course, many ways to represent sequences in terms of pairs.

The use of pairs to represent sequences of elements as lists is accompanied by conventional programming techniques for manipulating lists by successively “cdring down” the lists.
